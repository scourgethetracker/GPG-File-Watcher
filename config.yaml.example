# GOOGLE DRIVE INTEGRATION
# ============================================================================
# When Google Drive is enabled (via --google-drive flag), encrypted files are
# uploaded directly to Google Drive and NOT saved to destination_directory.
# This is ideal for cloud-only storage without local encrypted copies.
# 
# To use both local and Google Drive storage, run without --google-drive flag
# and keep google_drive_enabled: false

# Enable Google Drive upload (can also be enabled with --google-drive flag)
# When enabled: Files go directly to Google Drive (no local encrypted copy)
# When disabled: Files go to destination_directory (traditional behavior)
google_drive_enabled: false

# Google Drive folder ID where files should be uploaded
# Set to null to upload to root folder
# To find folder ID: Open folder in browser, ID is in URL after /folders/
# Example: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC...XYZ <- this is the ID
google_drive_folder_id: null

# Path to Google Drive credentials JSON file
# Get from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 1. Create a new project or select existing
# 2. Enable Google Drive API
